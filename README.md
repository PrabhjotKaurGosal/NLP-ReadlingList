# NLP-ReadlingList

This repository contains reserach papers and other reading material that I found interesting and helpful during my reserach in this field. My current reserach project is on language translation (focusing on speech to speech translation). Therefore, most of the reading material below belongs to that area, with some exceptions. 
PS: By no means is this list complete. I will continue to update the list as I learn more.
